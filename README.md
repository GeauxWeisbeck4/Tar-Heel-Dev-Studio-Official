# Tar Heel Dev Studio

This is a basic HTML starter project that I decided was right for Tar Heel Dev Studio. It just feels like how a Tar Heel would do it.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: Learn more about this project.

← `index.html`: This is the main web page for the website. This took a lot of time to create because I flirted with the design for so long - so worth it though.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it.

← `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript. The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads, and when the visitor clicks the button you can add below.

Open each file and check out the comments (in gray) for more info.
